Solving both the Commodity Transportation and Space Management problems using breadth-first search, depth-first search and A* with 2 heuristics.

## Commodity Transportation Problem: Bridge and Torch
In the traditional Bridge and Torch problem, we have to move four people, over a narrow bridge at night. The bridge can only hold two people at a time and thus the torch has to be used to cross the bridge. It takes person A one minute, B two, C five, and D eight minutes, respectively, to cross the bridge. When two persons are crossing the bridge together, they both move at the pace dictated by the slower person. The task is get the group across the bridge in the minimum time. 

The task was to solve the above problem for the case of 6 persons P = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, with specified crossing times for each person, for example, T = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13}. The UI prompts the user for the corresponding times, specified in an increasing order. 

## Space Management Problem: 8 Puzzle
The game is played on a 3x3 board with 8 of the tiles having the numbers ‘1’ through ‘8’ on them. Initially these tiles are in a random order. One space is left blank. The goal is to arrange the tiles in the order specified by the user.
